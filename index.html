    <h2 class="work">Theorists</h2>
    <p>There have been many “crazy” people preaching about the apocalypse and how the end is nigh for a very long time. From well-known philosophers to distant radio hosts, there is always a common theme.
One of many famous apocalypse prophets is known as Nostradamus. Born Michel de Nostredame, Nostradamus was widely known for his predictions about the future. Many of which have been very on point with our modern-day technological advances. He left nearly 1000 small letters with four line verses that were almost always very cryptic. He left these predictions in forms of symbolism, anagrams, and mythological allusions. This was almost a form of puzzling, impending doom poetry.
