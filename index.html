    <h2 class="exa">Theorists</h2>
    <p>There have been many “crazy” people preaching about the apocalypse and how the end is nigh for a very long time. From well-known philosophers to distant radio hosts, there is always a common theme.
One of many famous apocalypse prophets is known as Nostradamus. Born Michel de Nostredame, Nostradamus was widely known for his predictions about the future. Many of which have been very on point with our modern-day technological advances. He left nearly 1000 small letters with four line verses that were almost always very cryptic. He left these predictions in forms of symbolism, anagrams, and mythological allusions. This was almost a form of puzzling, impending doom poetry.

  <div class="prophecies" id="prophecies">
    <h2 class="exa">Prophecies</h2>
    <p>One of the most well-known prophecies is that of the Book of Revelations. The earth will face destruction in many forms. People will have to suffer from earthquakes, fire, plague, hailstorms, famine and many other calamities, in all shapes and forms. After these cataclysmic events, the Antichrist will gain domination over the world. They will rule the world for a certain unknown amount of time, which will then be followed by Armageddon. During Armageddon, a colossal battle will occur between the forces of evil (the Antichrist) and the forces of good (Jesus Christ), in which Jesus prevails. The Bible itself never gives specific dates, of course; instead all of its prophecies are based on a timeline of milestones and events.

  <div class="hist-rep" id="hist-rep">
    <h2 class="exa">Historic Repetition</h2>
    <p>Historic recurrence is the repetition of similar events in history. The concept of historic recurrence has variously been applied to the overall history of the world (e.g., to the rises and falls of empires), to repetitive patterns in the history of a given polity, and to any two specific events which bear a striking similarity.
Hypothetically, in the extreme, the concept of historic recurrence assumes the form of the Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence, which has been written about in various forms since antiquity and was described in the 19th century by Heinrich Heine and Friedrich Nietzsche.
Nevertheless, while it is often remarked that "History repeats itself," in cycles of less than cosmological duration this cannot be strictly true.
In this interpretation of recurrence, as opposed perhaps to the Nietzschean interpretation, there is no metaphysics. Recurrences take place due to ascertainable circumstances and chains of causality. An example of the mechanism is the ubiquitous phenomenon of multiple independent discovery in science and technology, which has been described by Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman.
